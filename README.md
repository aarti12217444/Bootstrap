🎯 How It Works
✔ Uses Bootstrap’s grid system for layout:

Copy
Edit
<div class="row text-center justify-content-evenly"> ... </div>
✔ Bootstrap Cards with images:


<img src="..." class="card-img-top object-fit-cover" style="height: 200px;" alt="...">
✔ Responsive columns with col-sm-5 col-md-3 to adapt on mobile and desktop.
